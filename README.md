# Hangman game / Pendu - HT
## What is the project?
The project is a hangman game, where the words are stocked in an online database. We get them randomly with an API call and there is a leaderboard.
## Features done
• Display the random animal name (from the API) <br />
• Display leaderboard (from the API) <br />
• Dark mode <br />
• Some random CSS...
## Difficulty
Too much, woke up at 8am, coded non stop until 11:58pm...(to be honest, i'm the one who wants to hang myself :'( )

## What did I learn ?
New code syntaxes, such as:

• Contexts
```js
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react'
```
• Maps
```js
{map(datas, (data) =>
    map(data, (score) =>
    <p>{score.username} : {score.score}</p>)
)}
```
Be patient even if I can do anything, determined to do some stuff, perseverant, not let anything down. But it was a pretty rough day of code, very difficult and mentally damaged.
