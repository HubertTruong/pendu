## Difficulties
Very hard and long to code, I'm new to this. I woke up at 8am and started to code until 11:58pm, it was very long and i'm mentally damaged from this tough day.

## What did I learn ?
I really don't remember, but maybe some random stuff: <br />
• Context
```js
import React, {useEffect, useState} from 'react'
```
• Map
```js
{map(datas, (data) =>
    map(data, (score) =>
    <p>{score.username} : {score.score}</p>)
)}
```
